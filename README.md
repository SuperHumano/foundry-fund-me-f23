# This is a foundry found me project

## About:

Fund me is a solidity written contract that has two functionalities:
### 1.Fund
### 2.Withdraw
If the funding is bigger than 5 dollars, the transaction will be send, else "You need to spend more ETH!".
Different multiple addresses can fund the contract but only the owner can withdraw.

The main goal is to deploy the contract as a script using foundry, optimizing the process, and
then testing it propperly.
